# qvdpautest - VDPAU Testing Tool

*Important:* I, Robert Massaioli, am not the original author of this tool. But I do maintain it in the
hope that it continues to be as useful to other people as it is to me.

This is a little VDPAU benchmarking tool.
For example, there are the results on a GT216 :

    qvdpautest 0.5
    Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU         E8500  @ 3.16GHz
    NVIDIA GPU GeForce GT 220 (GT216) at PCI:1:0:0 (GPU-0)
    
    VDPAU API version : 1
    VDPAU implementation : NVIDIA VDPAU Driver Shared Library  195.22  Sun Nov 22 17:37:18 PST 2009

## Required Dependencies

You will require a Linux install with the following dependencies:

 - A basic build environment with C++
 - CMake
 - qt Dev Tools (like qmake)
 - Something that will provide libvdpau.so

This is not an exhaustive list but will highlight some things that you will need.

## Compile and run:

I wrote a script that will build the code and run it for you. Just open a terminal and type in the following commands:

    $ bash -e build_and_run.bash

If this script fails then you are probably missing dependancies. The results will appear once the test is complete.

*Important:* NVidia users please SET POWERMIZER TO "Maximum Performance" in nvidia-settings.

## Questions and Comments 

Let me know if it doesn't work as expected.
